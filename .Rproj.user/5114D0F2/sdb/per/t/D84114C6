Even though the slightly different numbers indicates some sort of gender and acceptance irrelavance, it is worth studying how Williams College setting affects the students of each gender's academic stand. \nThis study focuses on the proportions of students of each gender from each class year from 2003 to 2016 who graduated with Latin honors as an indicator of academic achivement of each student gender.\n\n\n# Proportions\nIn this paper, \\samp{proportion} refers to the proportion of Williams students of each gender who graduated with Latin honours. The number can is obtained by dividing the number of students who graduated with Latin honors by the total number of students in the same class year of that gender. The proportions of female and male students are compared in this fashion to prevent the interferance from the fact that students of one gender are more likely to received Latin honors than the other if there are more students of that gender.\n\n\n# Data\n\nThe information of Williams College graduating classes were from Williams College Bulletin pdf files available on the Office of the Registrar of Willaims College website \\citep{registrar}. The files were converted into text files using online file converter and manually modified. At this point, the files contain only the information of graduating students, but still need more manipulation from the functions in the package.\n\n\n#getHonorName\n\n\\code{getHonorName()} extracts information from the section indicated by Latin honors. It takes 2 arguments: \\samp{file_name} and \\samp{honor}. \\samp{file_name} are the file name of the graduating class information in the package. They start from \\samp{t0203.txt} for class of 2003 to \\samp{t1516.txt} for class of 2016. \\samp{honor} indicates the section that the names should be taken from. They can be \\samp{all}, \\samp{summa}, \\samp{magna}, \\samp{cum}, and \\samp{none}.\n\nThe returned value is in data frame with one column of Latin honor from the input and one column for other information that will be cleaned later.\n\n```{r getHonorName}\nhonor.data <- getHonorName(\"t0203.txt\", \"all\")\nhonor.data[1:15,]\n```\n\n\n#cleanData()\n\nThe dataframe from \\code{getHonorName} contains some elements such as section headers, non-names, and some special marks. Working with internal helper functions, \\code{cleanData()} detects and gets rid off these elements, leaving only vital elements that represent students.\n\nIt takes one argument, a dataframe from \\code{getHonorName()}. First names are separated from the other parts and a gender column is added to the data frame.\n\n```{r cleanData}\nclean.data <- cleanData(honor.data[1:15,])\nclean.data\n```\n\nHowever, due to the limitation of \\pkg{gender} package, the gender of some names, especially non-English names, are NA.\n\n#ratio()\n\n\\code{ratio()} returns a table of the proportions from the input which is a dataset in the package.\n\n```{r ratio}\nratio(wstudent.three)\n```\n\n\n#Internal Datasets\nThe package provides ready-to-use datasets; they are datasets \\samp{wstudent.[classyear]}s and \\samp{all.ratio}. \n\n\\samp{wstudent.[classyear]}s are the clean version of text files that are manipulated by above functions are saved as datasets within the package and they are ready for users. It contains all students in the class year. To use the datasets, call \\code{data()} on their names from the list: \\samp{wstudent.three}, \\samp{wstudent.four}, \\samp{wstudent.five}, ..., \\samp{wstudent.sixteen}. For example, to get the dataset for class of 2003,\n\n```{r dataset.student}\ndata(wstudent.three)\nwstudent.three[1:15,]\n```\n\n\\samp{all.ratio} returns a table of the proportions of each gende from class of 2003 to 2016. To get the dataset,\n\n```{r all.ratio}\ndata(all.ratio)\nall.ratio\n```\n\n\n#stat_rep()\nAll information can be presented in five statistical prepresentations using \\code{stat_rep()}. Options are\n\\samp{prop.sum}: a summary of the proportions\n\\samp{box.plot}: a box plot of the proportion summary\n\\samp{t.testing}: a hypothesis test on the proportion of each gender\n\\samp{time.plot}: a proportion of each gender over time\n\\samp{annual}: a summary table for each class year\n\n\n```{r annual}\nstat_rep(\"annual\")\n```\n\n```{r time.plot}\nstat_rep(\"time.plot\")\n```\n\n```{r prop.sum}\nstat_rep(\"prop.sum\")\n```\n\n```{r box.plot}\nstat_rep(\"box.plot\")\n```\n\n```{r t.testing}\nstat_rep(\"t.testing\")\n```\n\n\n\n#Analysis\n\n#Conclusion\n\n\\bibliography{RJreferences}\n",
