Even though the slightly different numbers indicates some sort of irrelavance in gender and acceptance, the impact of Williams College settings on adacemic standing of students of each gender is worth studying. \n\nThe paper focuses on the proportions of students of each gender from each class year from 2003 to 2016 who graduated with Latin honors as an indicator of academic achivement of students.\n\n\n\n# Proportions\nIn this paper, \\samp{proportion} refers to the proportion of Williams students of each gender who graduated with Latin honors. The number is obtained by dividing the number of students who graduated with Latin honors by the total number of students of that gender in the same class year. The proportions of female and male students are compared in this fashion to prevent the interferance from the fact that students of one gender are more likely to received Latin honors than the other if there are more students of that gender.\n\n\n\n# Raw Data\n\nThe information of Williams College graduating classes were from Williams College Bulletin pdf files available on the Office of the Registrar of Willaims College website \\citep{registrar}. The files were converted into text files using online file converter and manually modified. At this point, the files contain only the information of graduating students, but still need more manipulation from the functions in the package.\n\n\n\n#getHonorName()\n\n\\code{getHonorName()} extracts information from the section indicated by Latin honors. It takes 2 arguments: \\samp{file_name} and \\samp{honor}. \\samp{file_name} are the file name of the graduating class information in the package. They start from \\samp{t0203.txt} for the class of 2003 to \\samp{t1516.txt} for the class of 2016. \\samp{honor} indicates the section that information should be taken from. They can be \\samp{all}, \\samp{summa}, \\samp{magna}, \\samp{cum}, and \\samp{none}.\n\nThe returned value is in dataframe with one column of Latin honor and one column of other information that will be cleaned later.\n\n```{r getHonorName}\nhonor.data <- getHonorName(\"t0203.txt\", \"all\")\nhonor.data[1:15,]\n```\n\n\n\n#cleanData()\n\nThe dataframe from \\code{getHonorName()} contains some elements such as section headers, non-names, and some special marks. Working with internal helper functions, \\code{cleanData()} detects and gets rid off these elements, leaving only vital elements that represent students.\n\nIt takes a dataframe from \\code{getHonorName()} as its only argument. The functino seaparates first names from middle and last names. The gender column is also added to the data frame.\n\n```{r cleanData}\nclean.data <- cleanData(honor.data[1:15,])\nclean.data\n```\n\nHowever, due to the limitation of \\pkg{gender} package, the gender of some names, especially non-English names, are NA.\n\n\n\n#ratio()\n\n\\code{ratio()} takes an internal dataset from \\samp{wstudent.xxx} series (see more details in \\samp{Datasets} section below) in the package as its only argument. It returns a table of the proportions of that input.\n\n```{r ratio}\nratio(wstudent.three)\n```\n\n\n\n#Datasets\nThe package provides ready-to-use datasets; they are datasets \\samp{wstudent.xxxx} series and \\samp{all.ratio}. \n\n\\samp{wstudent.xxxx}s are the clean manipulated version of text files that are saved as datasets within the package. A dataset in this series contains all students in the class year, their genders, and Latin honors they received. To use the datasets, call \\code{data()} on their names from the list: \\samp{wstudent.three}, \\samp{wstudent.four}, \\samp{wstudent.five}, ..., \\samp{wstudent.sixteen}. For example, to get the dataset for class of 2003,\n\n```{r dataset.student}\ndata(wstudent.three)\nwstudent.three[1:15,]\n```\n\n\\samp{all.ratio} dataset is a table of the proportions of each gender from class of 2003 to 2016. To get the dataset,\n\n```{r all.ratio}\ndata(all.ratio)\nall.ratio\n```\n\n\n\n#stat_rep()\nAll information can be presented in five statistical prepresentations using \\code{stat_rep()}. Options are\n\n\\samp{annual}: a summary table for each class year\n\\samp{time.plot}: a proportion of each gender over time\n\\samp{prop.sum}: a summary of the proportions\n\\samp{box.plot}: a box plot of the proportion summary\n\\samp{t.testing}: a hypothesis test^[one sided, 95% confidence interval with alpha of 0.05] on the proportion of each gender\n\n\n```{r annual}\nstat_rep(\"annual\")\n```\n\n```{r time.plot}\nstat_rep(\"time.plot\")\n```\n\n```{r prop.sum}\nstat_rep(\"prop.sum\")\n```\n\n```{r box.plot}\nstat_rep(\"box.plot\")\n```\n\n```{r t.testing}\nstat_rep(\"t.testing\")\n```\n\n\n\n#Analysis\n\nExploiting the ready-to-use internal datasets in the package, the annual report of students of each gender who graduated with Latin honors are provided. Nevertheless, these figures take the total number of students for granted, causing a bias mentioned in the introduction section. Therefore, it is more reasonable to study the proportions of each gender than the absolute numbers.\n\nThe dataset \\samp{all.ratio} displays the proportions of students of each gender who graduated with Latin honors from the class of 2003 to 2016. Even though the total number of students of each gender are taken into account, the figures still implies difference gaps of gender proportions. The time plot allows brief proportion comparison. Only in 2004 and 2014 were the male proportions above the female proportion. Essential statistical numbers are shown in five-summary table. All figures in female column are higher than the figures in the same row in male column. The comparison is more obvious in the box plot when the whole box of female students is located higher that of male students. Before making a conclusion that more female students have been receiving Latin honors in the past 14 years, the difference gaps need to be proved whether it is significant. \n\nA hypothesis test is conducted with the null hypothesis that the female proportion is not greater than the male proportion. With the p-value of 0.0001867, the result suggests the rejection of the null hypothesis. That is, the female proportion is significantly greater than the male proportion.\n \n\n\n#Conclusion\n\nFrom the analysis, it can be concluded that female Williams students have been graduating with higher GPA (receving Latin honors) than male students have for over 10 years. The result suggests that the environments Williams College provides foster female students's achevement, in terms of GPA, than they do to male students.\n\n",
